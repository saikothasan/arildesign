# React Hooks Explained: A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners

React Hooks have revolutionized the way we write React components. This guide will help you understand and start using Hooks in your React applications.

## What are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

## Why Use Hooks?

- Simplify component logic
- Reuse stateful logic between components
- Compose multiple hooks for complex logic

## Common Hooks

### 1. useState

Manages state in functional components.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
